# Homework Planet

Homework Planet is a simple browser-based game site made for when you’re bored in class, at home, or anywhere else. No downloads, no accounts, no clutter — just click and play.

The site is intentionally lightweight so it loads fast and works on most school networks.

## Games on the Site

- **Slope**  
  A fast reflex game where you control a ball going down an endless track. It starts easy and ramps up quickly.

- **Flappy Bird**  
  The classic rage game. Tap to flap, don’t hit anything, and see how far you get.

- **Minecraft Classic**  
  The original browser version of Minecraft. Pure creative mode with no survival mechanics.

- **Tag**  
  A local multiplayer game where players chase each other on the same keyboard. One person is “it,” and you don’t want to be them when time runs out.

Each game opens on its own page so it doesn’t break the layout or navigation.

## How the Site Works

The entire site is static HTML and CSS.  
Each game is embedded using an iframe and runs directly in the browser.

There is no backend, no database, and no tracking.
